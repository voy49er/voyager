### About voyager field
Our custom maskable match field, also named voyager, is based on IP protocol and OpenFlow experimenter extensions. It uses IP protocol number 192, and the length is 128 bits, which can be extended as needed. For OpenFlow, this field has oxm_class=0xffff and oxm_field=77. It borrows ONF_EXPERIMENTER_ID (0x4f4e4600) as its experimenter ID. We add support for it in OVS 2.15.0.
